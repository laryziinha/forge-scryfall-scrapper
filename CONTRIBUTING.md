# Contributing to Forge Scryfall Scrapper

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing 🙂

This project started as a **personal hobby** to solve real problems when managing
local Forge installations with Scryfall images.  
It is shared publicly in case it helps others, but development time is limited
and changes are driven by practical needs.
